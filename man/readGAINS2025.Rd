\title{Read air pollution emissions, activities and emission factors from GAINS data}
\usage{
readGAINS2025(subtype, subset = "baseline.det")
}
\arguments{
\item{subtype}{"emifacs", "emissions","activities", "GCI"}

\item{subset}{scenario and aggregation level ("agg" or "det"), separated by a dot}
}
\value{
Activity levels, emissions or emission factors. Alternatively,
a Government Capacity Index (GCI) used for deriving some scenario
extensions.
}
\description{
There's no associated convert function, as the disaggregation takes
a combination of subtypes, and it is easier to carry out most
calculations at the GAINS regional level first and then disaggregate
the results
